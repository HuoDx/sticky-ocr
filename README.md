## What is it?

TL;DR: Draw a box on your screen; all the text inside is delivered as text and copied to your clipboard.

Sticky OCR is a simple OCR application that displays the results like a sticky note on the screen. It takes screenshot by calling Mac's native `screencapture` command and then does optical character recognition (OCR) via [Tesseract.js](https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com). 

And it's a project that was actually inspired by my personal need :)

## How to use it?

Download a release version (when there's any) and install it on your Mac. You can close the window anytime you like but don't kill the process using `Cmd+Q` or just kill it somehow. You want it running in the background.

When you feel like you need to extract some info from your screen, press `Option+Shift+S` (lol, Windows users know what this means), then an empty sticky note will pop up on your window; then you'll find your cursor turning into a cross to indicate that you can begin selecting the area you wanna capture. When the OCR is done, the text will appear in the sticky note window and also get copied to your clipboard for your convinience.

## Looks useful? Wanna contribute?

This project originated by a simple inspiration and was initially finished within a day - there's a lot to be done.

So if you want to contribute, feel free to do it!

Currently I'm thinking a few possible needs:
  - Development: this thing looks still quite primitive and shabby, so if you want to make it better, that'll be great!
  - Branding: maybe it'll be cool if we can have a nice logo or a better name.
  - Design: if you know how to make the user experience better, you're greatly welcomed ;D

Anyway, do it the way you feel like doin' it and have fun!

Feel free to contact me.
